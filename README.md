I'm a software engineer living in Tokyo, JP working on high frequency trading.

In my spare time I like to work on open source sometimes.

I'm a core developer on the [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) project, and I like to make plugins for it
in Lua, such as my most popular which is the [colorizer](https://github.com/norcalli/nvim-colorizer.lua). You
can frequently find me on the [Neovim gitter](https://gitter.im/neovim/neovim) hanging out or the Handmade
Hero discord.

Also I've recently started streaming on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/ashkankiani).
